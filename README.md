# 4th Microverse Project: Building with Backgrounds and Gradients.

> This is a personal project I built for the Microverse Main Curriculum course. It is meant to showcase everything I've learned about background images, gradients, and building layouts with these features.

The assignment for the project was to build a clone of an old version of Apple's website, linked [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/). 

Solo project, let me learn how to make containers work together with the background images and links.
